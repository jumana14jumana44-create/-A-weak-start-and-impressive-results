## 📚 Python Basics Flow

These lessons form the backbone of any programmer’s toolkit. Mastering them is essential before delving into specialized libraries and advanced topics.

### 1. Input & Output (I/O)

**Completed Lessons:**
- Working with basic data types (String, Integer, Float)
- Using the `print()` and `input()` functions
- Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

### 2. Control Flow & Logic

**Lesson 3: Conditionals**
- Statements: `if`, `elif`, `else` for decision-making
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`)
- Boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`)

**Lesson 4: Loops**
- Iterating with `for` and `while` loops
- Loop control: `break` and `continue`

### 3. Functions & Structure

**Lesson 5.1 (Almost complete): Definition and Parameters**
- Defining functions with `def`
- Parameters and default arguments

**Lesson 5.2 (In progress): The Return Statement**
- Understanding the difference between `print` and `return`
- Storing returned values in variables

### 4. Core Data Structures

**Lesson 6: Lists**
- Creating lists and element indexing
- List operations: `append`, `insert`, `remove`

**Lesson 7: Dictionaries**
- Key-value pair structure
- Adding, modifying, and deleting entries

**Lesson 8: Tuples & Sets**
- Immutable groups: Tuples
- Storing unique items: Sets

### 5. Integration & Advanced Applications

**Lesson 9: Advanced Flow Control**
- Iterating through data structures (e.g., lists)
- Combining loops with conditionals
- List comprehensions

**Lesson 10: Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Introduction to classes and objects
- Simple code organization

**Lesson 11: File Handling & Error Management**
- Reading and writing to text files
- Error handling with `try` and `except`
